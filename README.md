# Group Project 1- Using Api's
Group members- George, Saul, Maisha, Eddie
What we chose as our group project was to make a website using a API from a show ticket vendor like Ticketmaster or Eventbrite. and the other API showing similar artist of selected artist. We thought the practicality of this would be to give the user the opportunity to search in any city for upcoming concerts and inform them of similar artist while doing so. We called this website Titan Tickets. Getting the concert api to load the way we wanted it to was a challenge because the javascript code had to be rewritten for each indivdual concert or "flash-card"
the way we thought would look best. It was thanks to George we were able to do this succesfully as he was the one able to grasp the tedious code we needed. 

## The workload
We split the workload by filetype. Saul helped out with the html file, George the Javascript, Edson the css and Maisha influenced with both the html and css. The most difficult part was having to wait on eachother to finish x-code to use it to help create y-code. This is a good real world example of what writing code with a team of people can be experienced like. Patience, understanding, and teamwork are major key players.
